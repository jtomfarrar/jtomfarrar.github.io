My research focuses principally on air-sea interaction and on the fluctuations and changes in ocean currents, density, and heat content in the upper ocean.  I pursue these interests using measurements of the upper ocean and lower atmosphere, collected either from satellites orbiting the earth or from ships, buoys, and autonomous ocean vehicles.
