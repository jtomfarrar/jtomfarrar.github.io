Research Interests
Ocean-atmosphere interaction; dynamics and thermodynamics of the upper ocean; tropical dynamics and equa-
torial waves; oceanic internal waves and eddies; satellite oceanography; ocean observing and instrumentation.
  These interests are pursued using in situ observations, satellite observations, and numerical models to test
hypotheses and test or formulate simplified physical models to help us understand ocean dynamics and air-sea
interaction.
